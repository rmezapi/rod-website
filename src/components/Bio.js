              I am passionate believer that the interaction between people and technology, through ethical and intentional construction and usage, can have a positive impact on society.  Specifically, I am passionate about computers and using them to create programs that can be used as tools to help improve peopleâ€™s live and our world. I recently received my degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I was able to explore my aspirations through my major in Computer Science. I also graduated with a minor in Statistics and Analytics and a minor in Studio Art with a concentration in Photography.
